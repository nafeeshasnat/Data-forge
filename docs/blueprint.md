# **App Name**: DataForge

## Core Features:

- Parameter Adjustment: Enable users to modify parameters like student count, subject details, grade distribution, and department ratios through an intuitive UI. The front end shows visual representation based on updated data.
- Synthetic Data Generation: Generate student datasets with adjustable parameters. Uses a Next.js backend to execute and manage the Python script.
- Data Visualization: Display the statistical data as graphs. Allow users to choose which dataset parameters they would like to compare.
- Downloadable Datasets: Allow users to download the generated synthetic datasets in JSON format for external use.
- AI-Powered Tendency Insights: Offer AI-driven suggestions on parameter settings based on historical data. Use a tool to recommend realistic value ranges to prevent generating nonsense data.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF) for a clean, technical, and informative feel.
- Background color: Light cyan (#E0FFFF) for a soft, unobtrusive background.
- Accent color: Dark slate gray (#2F4F4F) for interactive elements and key data points, creating contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' for a modern, readable, and neutral appearance, suitable for both headings and data display. This is a sans-serif font.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying configuration parameters or code snippets.
- Use minimalistic icons related to data analysis and settings, such as graphs, charts, and gear icons.
- Use subtle animations to visualize data loading and updates to show that data parameters were modified, maintaining a modern app feeling.
