Scripts and Algorithms

generate
- Implemented in src/lib/data-generator.ts.
- Creates synthetic student records by selecting performance groups, departments, and semester data.
- Uses configured distributions and grade scale to compute per-semester GPA and grades.
- Ensures stable IDs by using a local storage increment or deterministic seed.

merge_and_analyze.py
- Reads multiple dataset files (list of students or {meta, students}).
- Normalizes schema differences (semester formats, GPA fields, attendance fields).
- Computes per-student CGPA, average attendance, and per-semester GPA/credit load.
- Aggregates dataset summaries:
  - CGPA distribution bins.
  - Performance group distribution based on thresholds.
  - Department distribution.
  - HSC vs CGPA density.
  - Credit load vs grade and attendance vs grade.
  - Semester count and credit distributions.
- Writes a merged dataset file to tmp/ and returns summary + download filename.

trim_and_analyze.py
- Loads a dataset and removes students based on CGPA range and percentage.
- Recomputes analysis summaries on the remaining students.
- Writes a trimmed dataset file to tmp/ and returns summary + download filename.

analyze (server)
- Implemented in server/server.ts.
- Detects dataset vs single student input.
- Dataset: runs merge_and_analyze.py with a single file.
- Single student: derives GPA trend, credit load vs GPA, and attendance vs grade change.
- Returns analysis data for presentation only; no frontend calculations.
