Structure Rationale

Frontend
- Pages are organized under src/app/* for route-level components.
- Shared UI and layouts live in src/components to keep pages thin.
- Analysis visuals are centralized in AcademicPerformance and charts to avoid duplication.

Backend
- Express server handles file upload, script execution, and downloads.
- Python scripts are isolated to keep analysis logic separate from UI and server code.
- tmp/ is used for upload and generated artifacts with periodic cleanup.

Separation of Concerns
- Heavy analysis happens in Python or backend helpers.
- Frontend renders outputs only, using server responses and minimal transforms.
- Type definitions in src/lib/types.ts keep data contracts explicit.

Scalability Notes
- Merge and trim are script-based so they can be optimized or replaced independently.
- API endpoints are coarse-grained to keep frontend logic simple.
- Metadata handling is defensive to support older datasets without meta.
