Backend-Frontend Communication Setup

Routing
- Frontend routes are handled by react-router-dom.
- The server serves the compiled frontend from dist and falls back to index.html for SPA routes.

API Access
- The frontend calls backend endpoints under /api.
- Vite dev server proxies /api requests to the Express server (see vite.config.ts).

Endpoints (High Level)
- POST /api/merge
  - Accepts multiple files.
  - Runs merge_and_analyze.py and returns summary and download info.
- POST /api/trim
  - Accepts a filename (previously uploaded via /api/upload).
  - Runs trim_and_analyze.py and returns summary and download info.
- POST /api/upload
  - Uploads a dataset file for trimming and returns a temporary filename.
- GET /api/download/:filename
  - Downloads merged or trimmed dataset files from tmp.
- POST /api/analyze
  - Accepts a single file.
  - Detects dataset vs single student and returns either analysis summary or single-student chart data.

Methodology
- The frontend only presents results. All dataset-heavy analysis is computed on the backend scripts.
- API responses are JSON; some responses are transformed to camelCase for frontend usage.
- The backend writes merged/trimmed outputs to tmp/ and provides download links.

Error Handling
- Backend returns HTTP 4xx for invalid inputs or missing files, and 5xx for script failures.
- The frontend surfaces errors with toast notifications and inline error cards.
